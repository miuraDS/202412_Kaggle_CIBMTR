# Kaggle CIBMTR - Equity Post-HCT Survival Predictions

This repository contains the code and notebooks used for the Kaggle competition "[Equity Post-HCT Survival Predictions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/equity-post-HCT-survival-predictions/overview)".

The goal of this competition was to predict survival rates after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and to identify factors that contribute to disparities in outcomes.

## Methodology

This project uses a sophisticated ensemble of models to predict post-HCT survival. The core of the methodology involves:

*   **Advanced Feature Engineering:**
    *   **HLA Recalculation:** The HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) summary features were recalculated from individual HLA match columns to ensure accuracy and handle missing values.
    *   **New Feature Creation:** Several new features were engineered, including interactions between age and comorbidity scores, differences and ratios between donor and recipient ages, and combined features like `diabetes_obesity`.
    *   **External Data Integration:** An external dataset of age-related death rates was used to create features representing the baseline mortality risk for donors and recipients.

*   **Survival-Model-Based Targets:**
    *   Instead of directly predicting the event-free survival, this project uses survival analysis models (Cox Proportional Hazards, Kaplan-Meier, and Nelson-Aalen) to generate more robust and nuanced targets for the main predictive models.

*   **Ensemble Modeling:**
    *   The final predictions are generated by an ensemble of several models, including:
        *   LightGBM
        *   XGBoost
        *   CatBoost
        *   Neural Networks (with pairwise ranking loss)
    *   The ensemble combines the strengths of these different models to produce a more accurate and robust prediction.

*   **Rigorous Evaluation:**
    *   The models were trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation.
    *   The performance was measured using the stratified C-Index, with stratification by race group, as required by the competition.
